# Some important points:
0. Premise:
   - We want to consider class/section in a school as basic unit of study
   - As it is hard to track a student over time (given students dont always use same login id)
   - Teachers drive the engagement of a class with clix modules 
   - It depends on module's relevance for the topics they are teaching currently, teacher's motivation and other module/school specific features
   - Lools like clix labs are conducted for one or two days in any week, so we are counting time of engagement in weeks.
   - There are long gaps between rollout of same module in many schools (we are not counting those gaps into time of engagement)

1. Questions of interest:
   - Which modules/subjects(collection of modules of particular subject) were rolled out consistently over time
   - In other words, with which modules/subjects a classroom engaged consistently (over the period during which they were offered)
   - Can it be explained by school specific features, module specific features or teacher specific features

2. Some details:
   - We want to measure persistence of a module engagement from the time it starts to the time rollout is stopped
   - This can be measured using survival times of module engagement
   - Survival times can be a good measure of persistence as it accounts for the fact that event didnt happen till the end (and thus
     persisted till the end)  
   - Time to event is the time in weeks from start till the rollout of module is stopped (we dont count gaps in between)
   - It is simply number of weeks class engaged with module/tool 
   - Here we are looking at the behaviour of school teacher in terms of his interest in rolling out a particular module 
     to his class, as it is mostly driven by teachers 
   - Probably, modules which are bigger by design tend to be having longer time to event in general
   - But we need to establish this fact first through survival analysis 
   - If in fact the time to event for modules with more lessons is higher, then need to establish this by investigating if the number of lessons is 
     significant in determining time to event using cox-proportional hazard model positing on other factors.
   - If it is otherwise, then we can conclude that there are other factors like teachers interest, ease of assimilation into syllbus etc 
     which might be causing higher time to event for these modules. 
   - We can also see how this time to event changes with district, state and student/teacher ratio etc for a given module or tool 
   - Some factors which can affect this persistent engagement - domain, lessonscompleted, state, district, timespent, server on days, district, month, total students, total lab days

# Further Research
1. What external factors determine student engagement with different modules and tools - locality, teacher student ratio, IMT etc
2. Has the engagement increased over the period of execution of the project - may be due to some innovations in implementation at specific point during observation period
3. We could look at engagement in a particular tool (say policesquad) and determine what specific features of the game affect the engagement of students with the tool  

### Notes after doing some analysis as of 17th Nov, 2019:
 - We have math domain modules doing better than science statistically significantly 
 - Also schools whose teachers took tpd are doing better than those who didnt (assuming we have all teachers who took tpd in endline survey)
 - May be we want to do dummy variable CPH model fitting with mixed dummy variables to check the effect of math+tpd on math+no_tpd etc
